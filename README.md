iHIIT
=====

Do some High Intensity Interval Training or any other repetition based timed exercise sets directly on your Garmin device.


How does it work?
-----------------

You can configure up to 5 workouts, each of which can contain up to 20 exercises.
Each workout will have an exercise duration (by default 40 seconds) and a rest duration (by default 20 seconds).
Just name your workouts, name the exercises and get ready to sweat.

When you start the app on your watch it will propose you the workouts. Just hit the activity button and
iHIIT will lead you through your configured exercises alternating between exercise and rest periods.


What can you configure?
-----------------------
(For now the app can hold up to 5 workouts - I am doing some tests and most probably will bring this to 10 or even 15.)

- Workout title
- Workout exercise duration(seconds)
- Workout rest duration(seconds)
- List of exercises for each workout (1-20)

To hide a workout from your watch just leave its title blank (you don't have to delete all the exercises).

Also, exercises must be consecutive. The first blank exercise title will indicate the end of the workout.
